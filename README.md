# Youtube Data Analysis
YouTube allows billions of people to connect, inform, and inspire others across the globe using originally
created videos.
Test.test

In our Project we analyze the data to identify the top 5 categories in which the most number of videos are uploaded. The dataset is gathered using the YouTube API and stored in Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS).
MapReduce algorithm is applied to process the dataset and identify the video categories.

## Installing Hadoop On Cluster Instructions

 We are explaining the Hadoop cluster environment using four systems (one master and three slaves);
 Following are the IP addresses of the master and 3 slaves: master -192.168.1.7, slave 1- 192.168.1.6, slave 2- 192.168.1.9, slave 3- 192.168.1.4

 
### Installing Java

 Java is the main prerequisite for Hadoop. First of all, you should verify the existence of java in your system using “java -version”. 
` $ java -version `
 
If java is not installed in your system, then follow the given steps for installing java.


Step 1

Download java (JDK - X64.tar.gz) by visiting the following link http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

Then jdk-7u71-linux-x64.tar.gz will be downloaded into your system.


Step 2

Generally you will find the downloaded java file in Downloads folder. Verify it and extract the jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz file using the following commands.

`$ cd Downloads/`

`$ ls`

`jdk-7u79-Linux-x64.gz`

`$ tar zxf jdk-7u79-Linux-x64.gz`

`$ ls`

`jdk1.7.0_79 jdk-7u79-Linux-x64.gz`


Step 3

To make java available to all the users, you have to move it to the location “/usr/local/”. Open the root, and type the following commands.

`$ sudo mv jdk1.7.0_79 /usr/local/`


Step 4

For setting up PATH and JAVA_HOME variables, add the following commands to ~/.bashrc file.

`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.7.0_79`

`export PATH=PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin`


### Mapping the nodes

We have to edit hosts file in /etc/ folder on all nodes, specify the IP address of each system followed by their host names.


`$ sudo gedit /etc/hosts`

enter the following lines in the /etc/hosts file.

`192.168.1.7 hadoopmaster1`
`192.168.1.6 hadoopslave1`
`192.168.1.9 hadoopslave2`
`192.168.1.4 hadoopslave3`

Also edit the hostname file of each node.

### Configuring Key Based Login

Setup ssh in every node such that they can communicate with one another without any prompt for password.

`$ sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa` 

`$ sudo ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@hadoopmaster1` 

`$ sudo ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@hadoopslave1`

`$ sudo ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@hadoopslave2` 

`$ sudo ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@hadoopslave3`

`$ sudo chmod 777 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`


### Installing Hadoop

In the Master server, download and install Hadoop using the following commands.

`$ cd /opt/ `

`$ wget http://apache.mesi.com.ar/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.0/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz `

`$ tar -xzf hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz `

`$ mv hadoop-2.6.0 hadoop `

`$ cd /opt/hadoop/ `


### Applying Common Hadoop Configuration :

However, we will be configuring Master-Slave architecture we need to apply the common changes in Hadoop config files (i.e. common for both type of Mater and Slave nodes) before we distribute these Hadoop files over the rest of the machines/nodes. Hence, these changes will be reflected over your single node Hadoop setup. After that, we will make changes specifically for Master and Slave nodes respectively.
Changes:


### Update core-site.xml

Update this file by changing hostname from localhost to HadoopMaster


To edit file, fire the below given command

ubuntu@hadoopmaster1:/opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop$ sudo gedit core-site.xml


Paste these lines into <configuration> tag OR Just update it by replacing localhost with master

<property>

  <name>fs.default.name</name>
  
  <value>hdfs://HadoopMaster:9000</value>
  
</property>


### Update hdfs-site.xml

Update this file by updating repliction factor from 1 to 3.

## Run The Project

Run the nodejs server using the command.

`cd YouTube-Data-Analysis/WebContent/`

`nodejs app.js`

The project will be up and running at port `http://localhost:8080`

Click on `Get More Data` option on the sidebar to get new data via the YouTube API. After the data is stored in the server, a script will run in background to store the data in Hadoop File system.

Click on `Statistics` option on the sidebar to run the Hadoop MapReduce algorithm on the data. The `Analyze data` button will run the script to start hadoop MapReduce algorithm. The result will be displayed on the same webpage.
